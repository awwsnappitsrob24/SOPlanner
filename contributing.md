# Contributing

First off, I would like to thank you for thinking of making a contribution! This being my first app launch, I look forward to hearing any improvements/criticisms that you may have about the app.
Let's get to work! But first, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Try to refrain from making a duplicate request. Read through the previous requests first before submitting your own.
- Suggested READMEs should be clear and have a purpose.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestions!
